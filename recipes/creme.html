		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p><em><strong>Appears in JoJo: Diamond is Unbreakable. One of the dishes prepared by an Italian chef called Tonio who runs a newly opened restaurant in Morioh, Trattoria.</em></strong></p>
		<p><em><strong>Creme Caramel is a custard dessert with a layer of caramel sauce. It has been a staple of Mexican and Latin American cuisine since Spaniards brought it to Mexico during the Spanish occupation.</strong></em></p>
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
			<li>1/4 cup water</li>
			<li>1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened</li>
			<li>5 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
			<li>1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In a heavy saucepan, cook sugar and water over medium-low heat until melted and golden, about 15 minutes. Brush down crystals on the side of the pan with additional water as necessary. Quickly pour into an ungreased 2-qt. round baking or souffle dish, tilting to coat the bottom; let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350°. In a bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until thoroughly combined. Add remaining ingredients; mix well. Pour over caramelized sugar.</li>
			<li>Place the dish in a larger baking pan. Pour boiling water into larger pan to a depth of 1 in. Bake until the center is just set (mixture will jiggle), 50-60 minutes.</li>
			<li>Remove dish from a larger pan to a wire rack; cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
			<li>To unmold, run a knife around edges and invert onto a large rimmed serving platter. Cut into wedges or spoon onto dessert plates; spoon sauce over each serving.</li>
		</ol>
