		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p><em><strong>While it smells like the great pacific garbage patch, cuttlefish ink is a visually dramatic but orally subtle way to introduce some seafood flavors into your favorite pastas. Just be sure to explain its concept to JoJo before you serve it to him.</em></strong></p>
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul><p><strong>For the pasta:</strong></p>
			<li>2 ½ cups flour</li>
			<li>4 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 Tbsp black squid ink</li>
		</ul>
		<ul><p><strong>For the pasta sauce:</strong></p>
			<li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
			<li>2 Tbsp tomato puree</li>
			<li>½ shallot</li>
			<li>1 large clove garlic</li>
			<li>Red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
			<li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
			<li>2 Tbsp black squid ink</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In a stand mixer bowl, put in 2 ½ cups flour, create a well in the center, and crack in 4 large eggs along with 1 Tbsp of black squid ink. Gently beat that into the flour with a fork until a thick slurry is formed. Attach a dough hook and beat at medium to medium-low speed for 8-10 minutes. Add more flour or water as necessary until a smooth and tacky but not sticky dough is formed. Wrap in plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. If you’ve never had a wedding registry, then you probably don’t have a stand mixer, in which case you can knead the dough with your hands.</li>
			<li>After the dough has rested in plastic wrap, cut it into four equal parts, and wrap remaining three while working with the first quarter. Dust the dough liberally with flour, roll it out a bit, and pass it through the stand mixer roller on its widest setting. Laminate the dough by folding into thirds, then putting it through the roller again for 3-6 times, adding flour as necessary until the right consistency is achieved. Start rolling thinner and thinner until it is at the second to thinnest setting. Attach spaghetti cutter and roll through, lifting pasta away while gently twisting it into a loose knot to avoid tangling the pasta. Place on a rimmed baking sheet that’s covered in flour and repeat until all dough is in spaghetti strands. Cover in plastic wrap and place in fridge until it’s ready to be cooked.</li>
			<li>Open can of tomato puree, finely mince half a shallot, and peel one large clove of garlic to be crushed. In a high-walled saute pan, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil until it is shimmering. Dump in finely minced shallot and saute for about a minute. Then add in the crushed clove of garlic and sprinkle in some red pepper flakes if you want some heat. Let those flavors get to know each other for no longer than one minute before adding ¼ cup dry white wine (like Sauvignon Blanc). Add 2 tablespoons of tomato puree and simmer until white wine has evaporated which will be 3-5 minutes.</li>
			<li>During this, cook the pasta, which will only take about 1 minute because fresh pasta cooks very quickly. While the pasta is in the boiling water for no more than 90 seconds, add 2 Tbsps of black squid ink to the pasta sauce. When pasta is done add it directly to the sauce along with a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water which will help make it more cohesive and smooth. Rigorously mix and toss pasta to make it nice and creamy. Season with kosher salt if needed. Plate and enjoy!</li>
